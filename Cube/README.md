# Cubic Illuminance Sensor

A modular open-source illuminance sensor designed for environmental monitoring. The device uses a Raspberry Pi Zero with "Ambient 2 Click" sensors connected via a multiplexer, all enclosed in a laser-cut box.

## Features
- Measures ambient light in multiple directions (cubic configuration).
- Modular and customizable design using off-the-shelf components.
- Built with open-source hardware and software principles.

## Introduction
The Cubic Illuminance Sensor is designed to measure light levels from different angles for environmental sensing applications. It's based on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and 6 "Ambient 2 Click" sensors.

It is assumed that building suh a sensor requires previous knowledge and intent on it's purpose. 

However, if you want to learn more, please refer to [the paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1477153516631392) on which our design is based on.

## Calibration Setup

First, you have to calibrate the sensors. Refer to the [Cube Calibration Guide](docs/Cube_Calibration.md)

## Final Setup

After calibration, you can assemble the final cubic device

### Hardware Assembly

Laser cut the parts

Apply tape and masking tape, and then spray paint the parts

glue the first set of parts

place the sensors and other electronic parts in their place, screw and glue

glue and attach the first set of walls

Wire parts together and glue the wires

Plug in the ethernet cable to the RPi, so it goes through the hole in the top face

Glue and attach the rest of faces, leaving the top face without glue, but use just the screws

Before the final positioning, remove the masking tape from the lux sensor holes.

### Software

The software is pretty much the same as the one used in calibration

Remember to apply the edjustments figured out during the calibration

Set up a cron job however desired.

## Usage Instructions
- Describe how to use the sensor, adjust settings, and interpret the data.
- Provide examples, such as data logging or integration with other systems.
