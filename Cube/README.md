# Cubic Illuminance Sensor

![Final Cube Image](docs/Images/Cube_FinalAssembly_04.png)

An open-source cubic illuminance meter designed for environmental monitoring. The device uses a Raspberry Pi Zero with "Ambient 2 Click" sensors connected via a multiplexer, all enclosed in a laser-cut box.

## Features
- Measures ambient light in multiple directions (cubic configuration).
- Customizable design using off-the-shelf components.
- Built with open-source hardware and software principles.

## Introduction
The Cubic Illuminance Sensor is designed to measure light levels from different angles for environmental sensing applications. It's based on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and 6 "Ambient 2 Click" sensors.

It is assumed that building such a sensor requires previous knowledge and intent on it's purpose. 

However, if you want to learn more, please refer to [the paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1477153516631392) on which our design is based on.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

## 1. Calibration Setup

First, you have to calibrate the ==Ambient2Click== sensors. Refer to the [Sensors Calibration Guide](docs/01_Calibration.md) for instructions on how to do it.

## 2. Final Cube Assembly and Setup

After the sensors are calibrated, you can proceed to assemble the final cubic enclosure for all components.

Refer to the [Final Production Guide](docs/02_Final_Production_And_Assembly.md) for instructions.

## 3. Software

Software instructions can be found in the [Running Software](docs/03_Running_Software.md) guide.
